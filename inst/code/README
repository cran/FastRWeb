This directory is entriely optional but it contains example Rserve
configuration to run FastRWeb on a unix server

contents:

rserve.R     - R script that will be sourced by Rserve and can be used
               to pre-load packages, functiond and data in the Rserve
	       server instance so it is immediately available
	       to all client connections. See comments in the file
	       for details.

rserve.conf  - Rserve configuration file which enables the same socket
	       used by the Rcgi binary by default and causes rserve.R
	       to be sourced.
	       Note that this is a sample configurtaion file with very
	       relaxed permisson handling (any user on the machine can
	       connect) so for production system please read Rserve
	       documentation on how to restrict permissions and setup
	       a safe environment. We don't do this is the example
	       script because each unix distribution has different
	       system user names and setup.

start        - shell script that can be used to start the Rserve
	       instance serving this FastRWeb installation. It
	       simply uses the configuration described above.
	       To run in debug mode, add "-d" as the first parameter.
